# My-Machine-Learning

Hello! Welcome to my page! 

## Ex_ML
This folder contains examples of Machine Learning code in Python.

Mainly Pandas is used for data exploration and Sklearn for the Machine Learning models and tools.

So far it contains only Linear Models:
1. Classifcation Problem: Logsitc Regression used to classify leaves based on number of attributes
2. Reggression Problem: Bayesian Regression with Polynomial Basis Function used to predict NFL Running Back Yards

## ML_Notes:
This folder contains my personal notes on the mathematical foundation of the algorithms. 

Almost all of the content is derived from "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop
